{"name":"Toejough's Projects","tagline":"Projects I'm working on...","body":"# welcome\r\n\r\nWelcome!  Sorry for any rough edges - this is definitely under construction.\r\n\r\n# Projects by type\r\n\r\n## Ready for use\r\n\r\n### Pimento\r\n\r\nSimple CLI menus in python!  Also features a standalone command line utility of the same name.\r\nSee [the repo](https://github.com/toejough/pimento) or [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pimento) for a full README with examples, features, installation instructions, etc.\r\n\r\n### Dictmerge\r\n\r\nMerge python dictionaries recursively!  Also features the ability to set up custom conflict resolver functions, in case you don't want the default error behavior.  See [the repo](https://github.com/toejough/dictmerge) for a full README with examples, features, installation instructions, etc.\r\n\r\n### Dotfiles\r\n\r\nMy personal \"dotfiles\" directory!  Contains a large set of bash, readline, and tmux customizations/plugins.  See [the repo](https://github.com/toejough/dotfiles) for details.  Unfortunately, you'll mostly have to look at the source, because the README is pretty incomplete, but the code is all there and works great - I use it on several systems currently, and keep it up-to-date.\r\n\r\n## Instructional\r\n\r\n### PyPI-vs-NPM\r\n\r\nAn investigation/comparison of packaging with python and with server-side javascript.  The short answer is that NPM is MUCH simpler to use than PyPI is.  See [the repo](https://github.com/toejough/pypi-vs-npm) for the full writeup.\r\n\r\n### SSH Agent forwarding in Paramiko\r\n\r\nParamiko is *the* SSH library for Python.  As you might expect, it supports agent forwarding.  Unfortunately, it's not currently documented anywhere.  I wrote up some unofficial documentation in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/toejough/436540622530c35404e6).\r\n\r\n### Javascript Object Deep Copy\r\n\r\nJavascript objects are passed around by reference - if you really want a copy to modify, without affecting the original, you need to do get a deep copy.  Unfortunately, most frameworks (including the popular \"underscore\"), offer a function named \"clone\", which is only a shallow copy.\r\n\r\nI found and modified a simple (though not necessarily efficient) deep copy function, and present it [here](https://gist.github.com/toejough/df94aee238586c283b6f).  It basically converts the object to JSON, then back to an object, so it doesn't work on complex objects (for example, functions are not properly handled).  If you need a nested data structure copied, though, this does the trick pretty well.\r\n\r\n## Incomplete\r\n\r\n### Wisper\r\n\r\nA full regex pub/sub!  This is very experimental and hasn't been touched in a while, but I'll come back to it, I think.  See [the repo](https://github.com/toejough/wisper) for current status and more details.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
